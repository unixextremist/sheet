# what is it?

sheet is a minimal tui frontend for feh/swaybg inspired by nitrogen made for both xorg and wayland window managers

# what advantages does it have over just feh or swaybg?

as someone who doesnt use a gui file manager this was made so i could differentiate between all my different wallpapers that dont have descriptive names without manually viewing them all

# deps

- c
- ncurses
- feh or swaybg

- # build

`cc sheet.c -o sheet -lncurses`
